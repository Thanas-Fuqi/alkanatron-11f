## Overview

**Alkanatron** is a web-based tool designed to assist students in understanding and solving chemistry exercises, particularly those related to organic chemistry. The platform is accessible via any electronic device, such as a computer or smartphone, and aims to help students of all levels by providing an automated way to solve and verify chemistry exercises without the need for a teacher or third-party assistance.

### Why This Product?

Students are increasingly struggling to understand chemistry and science-related exercises. **Alkanatron** provides a solution by offering an intuitive platform where students can solve relatively simple exercises using a digital device, which most people have access to today.

### Why Focus on Alkanes?

Many people lack the means to solve simple exercises on their own. By using this website, they can check whether they have solved exercises correctly, without needing help from a teacher or another person. The website specifically targets the identification and naming of alkanes—a fundamental topic in organic chemistry.

## Functionality

The algorithm behind **Alkanatron** is designed to mimic the logical process a person would use to solve alkane structure identification exercises. The system has been thoroughly tested by developers to ensure that all potential issues have been addressed.

### How It Works

1. **Step 1: Identifying Terminal Carbons**  
   The algorithm first identifies carbon atoms that are connected to only one other carbon atom. These atoms are likely to be the terminal carbons of the longest carbon chain.

2. **Step 2: Finding the Longest Carbon Chain**  
   The algorithm explores all possible carbon chains and selects the longest one. The direction from which the chain starts can influence the positioning of substituents (radicals) on the chain.

3. **Step 3: Identifying Substituents**  
   Using the list of carbons not included in the longest chain, the algorithm determines the names and types of substituents (radicals) and then associates them with the main carbon chain.

4. **Step 4: Constructing the Alkane Name**  
   Finally, the algorithm assembles all parts to generate the correct IUPAC name for the alkane.

## Challenges

- **Input Translation:**  
  Translating the user's input into a numerical logic that the algorithm can understand and process. Computers can only interpret values that are numerically defined.

- **Code Refinement:**  
  Adjusting the code to accurately name all types of alkanes, including those that couldn't be named using the initial logic due to various complexities.
